BERTScore significantly outperforms other text evaluation metrics, because it utilizes contextual embeddings. These embeddings address the limitations of traditional word (or character based) metrics. However, this reliance on contextual embeddings also makes the metric dependent on the language and the quality of the pre-trained embedding model.",
