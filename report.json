She explains that if she bought everything she liked, she wouldn't have any money left to live on. Max agrees and they both laugh.\n\nPayton then reveals that she struggles to resist buying clothes and books, which are her two favorite things. She says she loves reading everything she can get her hands on. Max is impressed by Payton's love for books and asks for some recommendations.
