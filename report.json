Agata explains that her Twitter posts are automatically posted on Facebook, and she might change that. Guido misunderstands Agata's posts as being about Java, but Agata clarifies that they are about JavaScript. Guido finds the concept of programming difficult to understand. Agata acknowledges that she is new to coding and it is easy for people who have been coding for longer to understand. Guido asks about Agata's husband and whether he complains about her new job, but Agata assures him that he does not. Guido suggests that Agata speaks to him in the JavaScript language, which Agata finds amusing.",
