     <p>
      Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves assessing the quality, relevance, coherence, and
        sometimes the factual accuracy of the text generated by these models. This evaluation is crucial for understanding
        a model's performance across various tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation. Several automated
        metrics have been developed to facilitate this evaluation process, each with its own focus and methodology. Some
        prominent evaluation methods including BERTScore, BLEU, and METEOR.

        <div>
         BERTScore is a metric for evaluating the quality of text generation models,
for example machine translation or summarization that aligns well with human judgement.
BERTScore significantly outperforms other text evaluation metrics, because it utilizes contextual
embeddings. These embeddings address the limitations of traditional word (or character based) metrics.
However, this reliance on contextual embeddings also makes the metric dependent on the language
and the quality of the pre-trained embedding model.

Benjamin: Hey guys, what are we doing with the keys today?
Hilary: I've got them. Whoever wants them can meet me at lunchtime or after
Elliot: I'm ok. We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?
Hilary: Yeah, I guess so
Daniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me
Benjamin: Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday
Hilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off)
Benjamin: YAAAAWN 🙊 Where and where are you meeting?
Hilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen
Benjamin: Interesting 😱 To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear
Hilary: Oh come on 😂
Benjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take

Benjamin: Hey guys, what are we doing with the keys today?
Hilary: I've got them. Whoever wants them can meet me at lunchtime or after
Elliot: I'm ok. We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?
Hilary: Yeah, I guess so
Daniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me
Benjamin: Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday
Hilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off)
Benjamin: YAAAAWN 🙊 Where and where are you meeting?
Hilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen
Benjamin: Interesting 😱 To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear
Hilary: Oh come on 😂
Benjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take

Adam: No wonder...
Karen: I know, but I think this is serious. She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true
Adam: She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression
Adam: She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat
Karen: Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don't what to tell you
Adam: I was wondering how I can help her
Karen: Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse
Adam: Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone
Karen: Hm... I don't know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do
Adam: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name

Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

Igor: What do you mean?
John: Well, they say how you end things shows how you really are...
Igor: And now how you start, right?
John: Gotcha! 
Igor: So what shall I do then? 
John: It's only two weeks left, so grit your teeth and do what you have to do. 
Igor: Easy to say, hard to perform.
John: Come on, stop thinking, start doing! 
Igor: That's so typical of you!  ;)

Beth: Hi Auntie Deirdre, I'm been meaning to message you, had a favour to ask.
Deirdre: Wondered if you had any thought about your Mum's 40th, we've got to do something special!
Beth: How about a girls weekend, just mum, me, you and the girls, Kira will have to come back from Uni, of course.

Beth: Oh yeah, we had a surprise party for you, you nearly had a heart attack! 
Deirdre: Well, it was a lovely surprise! Gosh, thats nearly 4 years ago now, time flies! What was the favour, darling?
Beth: Oh, it was just that I fancied trying a bit of work experience in the salon, auntie.
Deirdre: Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? you could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form.
Beth: I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those.
Deirdre: What about a tutor? Kira could help you in the hols.
Beth: Maybe, but I'd like to try working. I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough.
Deirdre: I know. Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat.

Beth: OK, I like the sound of it! See you tomorrow Auntie! Love you!

Karen: Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don't what to tell you
Adam: I was wondering how I can help her
Karen: Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse
Adam: Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone
Karen: Hm... I don't know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do
Adam: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name
Karen: Of course I won't! I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. I'll let you know

Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt;

Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. 
Jesse: So it's settled?

Ola: Hello Kate, sorry for not keeping in touch properly. As expected, we have hardly any connectivity here in Cuba. But we're doing fine and enjoying our trip. How are the things at home?
Kate: At long last! Started to worry. Nothing new happening, if you disregard all that Xmas craze. Momo has recovered from her injury and frolicking again.
Kate: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Good old Momo! Yes, it is your scarf!
Ola: NO!!! It's one of my favorites! The one from Laos!
Kate: Too late. Momo thinks it belongs to her now. Get yourself a new one. They surely have nice ones there.
Ola: Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs.
Ola: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Wait a sec!
Kate: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Isn't it similar?! Mum would probably like it. Why don't you?
Ola: Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually crappy.
Kate: And if you go to some boutique shop or something? Not at a market as in your pics?
Ola: I might try and find some. Would you like one too?
Kate: Not really. And Mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic Cuban blouse :))
Ola: OK I'll have a look. Greets to everyone at home pls.
Kate: Take care!

Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!
Neela: See ya, love!
Clara: Bye!

Jesse: U'll get ur presents, no worries ;)
Maxine: Phew! Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;)
Melvin: Bt what do u have in store?

Lee: No. What's that?
Melvin: That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children?
Maxine: I think I've heard of them. So what about them?
Jesse: That's right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. 
Melvin: That's a great idea!
Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt;
Lee: I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange.
Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. 
Jesse: So it's settled?
Melvin: Yup.

Bill: Well, I’m sorry. We need to take care of the Lidem project right now.
Stanley: Yes I’m finishing the analysis for the pervious one, but it should be done tonight, so I can start working on it today
Bill: The problem is I don’t what you should do ;p
Stanley: whaaat
Bill: The analysis of tasks is not done yet, Alison disappeared from all the media and won’t answer her phone
Stanley: Great. So division of the tasks is on me?
Bill: Yes because I’m already researching when it comes to the funding.
Stanley: We’ll do, it’ll be ready tomorrow, not sure what time.
Bill: OK, keep me posted.
Stanley: Btw, it’s weird that Alison is out of touch
Bill: No at all, it’s not the first time
Stanley: Women…

Tim: Haha :) Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? And what games to bring?
Joe: yeah, sure - just a few general tips :)
Joe: Start games before you start drinking :) And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones :)
Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
Tim: Got it :D 
Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? 
Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... 
Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)
Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)
Tim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.
Joe: yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :)

Air France: Please, be awared it could take 24 hours
Sybille: I can't wait so long. My son is only 16 year old and he has to sleep in the airport, with no mean to leave his luggage as he has no ticket.
Air France: Hello Sybille, we're very sorry . We could offer you a departure on flight DL140 from Minneapolis to Paris. We'll return to you.
Sybille: My  phone number is XXXX, please call me back as soon as possible
Sybille: Hello, i was again on line with people from the  short number. They told me that they've done everything possible but my payment can't be accepted because the flight is operated by Delta. Please consider a young stuck in US with no possibilites  for coming back just because of Delta and Air France sharing code, can't  share payment. Shame on you.
Air France: We'll get in touch with Delta US  and return to you quickly
Sybille: thanks a lot
Air France: We just send  you by email the new ticket for you son. We remain at your disposal.
Sybille: Thanks a lot, you're more efficient than the  hotline.

Guido asks about Agata's husband and whether he complains about her new job, but Agata assures him that he does not. Guido suggests that Agata speaks to him in the JavaScript language, which Agata finds amusing.

Jess: Guys, last night I dreamt I was a lion tamer, does it mean I should go to Africa this summer? XD
Lynn: Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper? :D
Charlie: Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat?
Lynn: You've just spoiled all the fun! :P
Jess: Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth.
Charlie: Do you really believe that dreams can mean something?
Jess: No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;)
Lynn: Well...
Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?
Lynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think?
Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.
Jess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?
Charlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!

Bobby: U know what annoys me the most?
Mickey: Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions?
Bobby: That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs.
Mickey: Y? Aren't they good 4 ur health?
Bobby: They may well be, but not for my wallet!
Mickey: What do u mean?
Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on.
Mickey: And what of it?
Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. 
Mickey: All right, this is quite serious.
Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?
Bobby: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products!
Mickey: Srsly?!
Bobby: Absolutely!
Mickey: How long do u think they've been lying to us?
Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
Mickey: That is kinda puzzling.
Bobby: Right?
Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it?
Bobby: Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today?
Mickey: No.
Bobby: At least $1.2 bln!
Mickey: Explains a lot.
