        <div class="report-description"><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves assessing the quality, relevance, coherence, and
        sometimes the factual accuracy of the text generated by these models. This evaluation is crucial for understanding
        a model's performance across various tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation. Several automated
        metrics have been developed to facilitate this evaluation process, each with its own focus and methodology. Some
        prominent evaluation methods including BERTScore, BLEU, and METEOR.

for example machine translation or summarization that aligns well with human judgement.
BERTScore significantly outperforms other text evaluation metrics, because it utilizes contextual
embeddings. These embeddings address the limitations of traditional word (or character based) metrics.
However, this reliance on contextual embeddings also makes the metric dependent on the language
and the quality of the pre-trained embedding model.</div></block-article><block-article><div><report-caption>Model: Mistral merged aqua vllm container A10.2</report-caption><div class="group">

Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It&#39;s about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That&#39;s the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it&#39;s mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it&#39;s rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How&#39;s that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there&#39;s also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I&#39;m not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I&#39;ll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I&#39;m just watching the rest of a movie and I&#39;ll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don&#39;t blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!

Kate: At long last! Started to worry. Nothing new happening, if you disregard all that Xmas craze. Momo has recovered from her injury and frolicking again.
Kate: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Good old Momo! Yes, it is your scarf!
Ola: NO!!! It&#39;s one of my favorites! The one from Laos!
Kate: Too late. Momo thinks it belongs to her now. Get yourself a new one. They surely have nice ones there.
Ola: Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs.
Ola: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Wait a sec!
Kate: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Isn&#39;t it similar?! Mum would probably like it. Why don&#39;t you?
Ola: Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually crappy.
Kate: And if you go to some boutique shop or something? Not at a market as in your pics?
Ola: I might try and find some. Would you like one too?
Kate: Not really. And Mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic Cuban blouse :))

Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It&#39;s about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That&#39;s the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it&#39;s mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it&#39;s rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How&#39;s that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there&#39;s also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I&#39;m not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I&#39;ll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I&#39;m just watching the rest of a movie and I&#39;ll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don&#39;t blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!

Lee: Gr8 idea! Anything in mind?
Maxine: So no presents 4 me? :(
Jesse: U&#39;ll get ur presents, no worries ;)
Maxine: Phew! Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;)
Melvin: Bt what do u have in store?
Jesse: Well, have u heard about the Refuge?
Lee: No. What&#39;s that?
Melvin: That&#39;s the Christmas foundation to help women and children?
Maxine: I think I&#39;ve heard of them. So what about them?
Jesse: That&#39;s right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. 
Melvin: That&#39;s a great idea!
Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt;
Lee: I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange.
Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we&#39;ll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I&#39;m in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go.

Tim: And I wanted to consult the expert on the matter :)
Joe: As you know I&#39;m always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. You will just need to stop me when I get too wound up :D
Tim: Haha :) Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? And what games to bring?
Joe: yeah, sure - just a few general tips :)
Joe: Start games before you start drinking :) And don&#39;t bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones :)
Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
Tim: Got it :D 
Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some &#39;vanilla&#39; games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? 
Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... 
Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)
Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)
Tim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.
Joe: yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :)

Guido: Hi, Agata, are you OK?
Agata: Hi, Guido. Sure, I&#39;m OK :) And you?
Guido: I just have trouble understanding your posts on Facebook. 
Agata: Really?
Guido: Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t know anything about Java? :(
Agata: Thanks for the concern :) All my Twitter posts go to my Facebook account. I think I might change that! 
Guido: Don&#39;t worry :)
Agata: By the way, it&#39;s JavaScript, not Java. Except for the name they really have not much in common :)
Guido: Sounds like Chinese to me :(
Agata: :)
Guido: It&#39;s hard to understand the concept :(
Agata: Sorry. After just one month of coding I would be like plain English to you :P
Guido: I can see that you enjoy it.
Agata: I really do. Finally I found something interesting for me.
Guido: And what about you husband? 
Agata: What about him?
Guido: Doesn&#39;t he complain about your new job?
Agata: Not at all! Why would he? 
Guido: So you don&#39;t speak to him in Chinese language? I mean in JavaScript language, hahahha

Summary:
[/INST] Guido is concerned about Agata&#39;s posts on Facebook, which she also posts on Twitter. Agata explains that her Twitter posts are automatically posted on Facebook, and she might change that. Guido misunderstands Agata&#39;s posts as being about Java, but Agata clarifies that they are about JavaScript. Guido finds the concept of programming difficult to understand. Agata acknowledges that she is new to coding and it is easy for people who have been coding for longer to understand. Guido asks about Agata&#39;s husband and whether he complains about her new job, but Agata assures him that he does not. Guido suggests that Agata speaks to him in the JavaScript language, which Agata finds amusing.</td>

Charlie: Or you&#39;ll get attacked by a stray cat?
Lynn: You&#39;ve just spoiled all the fun! :P
Jess: Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth.
Charlie: Do you really believe that dreams can mean something?
Jess: No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;)
Lynn: Well...
Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?
Lynn: I&#39;m not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it&#39;s just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don&#39;t you think?
Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I&#39;ve read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people&#39;s faces, and it uses them when we dream.
Jess: So you&#39;re telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?
Charlie: Exactly! You don&#39;t even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!

Bobby: U know what annoys me the most?
Mickey: Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions?
Bobby: That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs.
Mickey: Y? Aren&#39;t they good 4 ur health?
Bobby: They may well be, but not for my wallet!
Mickey: What do u mean?
Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there&#39;s a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on.
Mickey: And what of it?
Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I&#39;m not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I&#39;ve never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. 
Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it&#39;s not an illness. 
Mickey: All right, this is quite serious.
Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?
Bobby: That in this particular case they&#39;re selling mints as medical products!
Mickey: Srsly?!
Bobby: Absolutely!
Mickey: How long do u think they&#39;ve been lying to us?
Bobby: Can&#39;t be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
Mickey: That is kinda puzzling.
Bobby: Right?
Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it?
Bobby: Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today?
Mickey: No.
Bobby: At least $1.2 bln!
Mickey: Explains a lot.
