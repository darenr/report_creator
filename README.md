Library to assemble reports in HTML from various components using python. This is not meant to be a replacement for do-it-yourself HTML,
it's a tool to put together professional looking reports from python easily and quickly. The philosophy for layout is that components flow in
either the horizontal (`rc.Group()`) or Vertical (`rc.Block()`) direction.

## âš¡ Features

- [x] Good pandas/dataframe/table support
- [x] Look modern
- [x] Allows markdown as input for text blocks
- [x] Allows html as input
- [x] Components for things like metrics ("Accuracy: 87%") from a key & value
- [x] Support for plotting figures, interactive `plotly` and `matplotlib`
- [x] images (styled by the library) with an option to fetch at report build time (no fetch on render)
- [x] `json`/`yaml`/`python`/`java`/`prolog`/`plaintext` code blocks with color syntax highlighting

## âš¡ Example

```python
import report_creator as rc

with rc.ReportCreator(
    title="My Report",
    description="My Report Description",
    footer="My Report Footer",
) as report:
    view = rc.Block(
        rc.Text(
            """It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.""",
            label="Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities",
        ),
        rc.Group(
            rc.Metric(
                heading="Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything",
                value="42",
            ),
            rc.Metric(
                heading="Author",
                value="Douglas Adams",
            ),
        ),
        rc.Bar(
            px.data.medals_long(),
            x="nation",
            y="count",
            dimension="medal",
            label="Bar Chart - Olympic Medals",
        ),
        rc.Scatter(
            px.data.iris(),
            x="sepal_width",
            y="sepal_length",
            dimension="species",
            marginal="histogram",
            label="Scatter Plot - Iris",
        ),
    )

    report.save(view, "report.html")
```
