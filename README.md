## Example

```python3

import report_creator as rc

with rc.ReportCreator("My Report") as report:

    view = rc.Block(
        rc.Text("""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.""", 
        label="Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities"),
        rc.Group(
            rc.Metric(
                heading="Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything",
                value="42",
            ),
            rc.Metric(
                heading="Author",
                value="Douglas Adams",
            ),   
        ),
        rc.Bar(px.data.medals_long(),
               x="nation",
               y="count",
               dimension="medal",
               label="Bar Chart - Olympic Medals",
        ),
        rc.Scatter(
            px.data.iris(),
            x="sepal_width",
            y="sepal_length",
            dimension="species",
            marginal="histogram",
            label="Scatter Plot - Iris",
        ),
    )

    report.save(view, "report.html") 
```

## Development

``` .python
conda create --name rc python=3.12
conda activate rc
pip install -r requirements.txt -U

# recommended installs for code hygiene
pip install ruff

# build "kitchen_sink" example
make

# install local package
pip install -e .

# see dependency tree
pipdeptree --exclude pip,pipdeptree,setuptools,wheel,twine

```

## Dev Notes

* **4/18/24 - no breaking changes**, all changes should go through standard deprecation policies
* The Blocks/Groups use css [flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
  * Blocks flow vertically (columns)
* Groups flow horizontal (row).
* To render math you'll need to `pip install md4mathjax`
