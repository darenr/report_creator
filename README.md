Library to assemble reports in HTML from various components using python. Inspired by DataPane which is no longer maintained and targetted more interactive use cases.

## âš¡ Features

- [x] Good pandas/dataframe/table support
- [x] Look modern
- [x] Allows markdown as input for text blocks
- [x] Allows html as input
- [x] Components for things like metrics ("Accuracy: 87%") from a key & value
- [x] Support for plotting figures, interactive `plotly` and `matplotlib`
- [x] images (styled by the library) with an option to fetch at report build time (no fetch on render)
- [x] `json`/`yaml`/`python`/`java`/`ptolog` code blocks with color syntax highlighting
- [x] Support tab containers (not printer friendly)
- [x] Add support for any Jupyter widget, any object that renders in a notebook should render to a report
- [x] Add built-in easy plotting that looks stylistically consistent with the report
- [x] Add option to change the report icon based on a github account avatar, or an image
- [x] Add a metric type for timeseries data which should some aggregate function of the data, and plot over time.
- [x] Add diagram component with Mermaid JS
- [x] Write documentation!
- [x] Add a status metric that supports up to a handful of k/v pairs (k=task, v=status)
- [x] Add bookmark anchors to blocks
- [x] Add Footer to report
- [x] Add accordion component
- [x] Add option for color logo (uses accent color param passed to ReportCreator ctor)
- [x] Clean up docs build, move requirements-doc into docs/environment.yaml "- -r requirements.txt"
- [ ] Add a Metric  type for a softable list of key/values rendered like this [Percent of time](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/image/serverpage/image-id/73682iEC88C630172A41FA/image-size/large)
- [ ] Progress component
- [ ] Add mistune plugin to allow gfk markdown icons - `:icon-name:`, for example `:pizza:`
- [ ] Add Venn diagram support (possibly with `matplotlib_venn`, or SVG)
- [ ] Add log file block [apachelogs](https://github.com/jwodder/apachelogs) with analytics
- [ ] Add Radar chart
- [ ] Add choropleth map plot type (maybe?)
- [ ] Youtube embeds rc.Video(url: str, label: str)
- [ ] File attachments (downloadable dataset from page)
- [ ] Switch logger to `logru`

## âš¡ Example

```python
import report_creator as rc

with rc.ReportCreator(
    title="My Report",
    description="My Report Description",
    footer="My Report Footer",
) as report:
    view = rc.Block(
        rc.Text(
            """It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.""",
            label="Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities",
        ),
        rc.Group(
            rc.Metric(
                heading="Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything",
                value="42",
            ),
            rc.Metric(
                heading="Author",
                value="Douglas Adams",
            ),
        ),
        rc.Bar(
            px.data.medals_long(),
            x="nation",
            y="count",
            dimension="medal",
            label="Bar Chart - Olympic Medals",
        ),
        rc.Scatter(
            px.data.iris(),
            x="sepal_width",
            y="sepal_length",
            dimension="species",
            marginal="histogram",
            label="Scatter Plot - Iris",
        ),
    )

    report.save(view, "report.html")
```
