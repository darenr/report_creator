Report Creator
==============

When you have data to share and want to be able to create a report that is easy to read and understand, you can use the Report 
Creator. This tool allows you to create a report in a few simple steps. You can add a title, a description, and a table of data. You 
can also add a chart to the report. The Report Creator will generate a report in HTML format that you can share with others.

``kitchen_sink.py`` is an example in the ``examples`` directory that demonstrates every component, and many of the options. The report
created by that can be seen |kitchen_sink_location_link|.
