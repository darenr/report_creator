     Model Evaluation Report
    </h1>
    <div class="report-description">
     <p>
      Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves assessing the quality, relevance, coherence, and
        sometimes the factual accuracy of the text generated by these models. This evaluation is crucial for understanding
        a model's performance across various tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation. Several automated
        metrics have been developed to facilitate this evaluation process, each with its own focus and methodology. Some
        prominent evaluation methods including BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE.

      Evaluation Metric
     </report-caption>
     <div>
      ROUGE scores compare a candidate document to a collection of reference documents to evaluate the similarity between them. 
    The metrics range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater similarity. ROUGE is more suitable for models that don't include paraphrasing and do not generate new text units that don't appear in the references. 
    The metrics are ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap), ROUGE-2 (bigram overlap), and ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence). The ROUGE scoreis calculated between the model's predictions and the human-produced references. A perfect model 
    would have a ROUGE score of 1.0, meaning the outputs from the model and the human-produced references are identical.

We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?\r\nHilary: Yeah, I guess so\r\nDaniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me\r\nBenjamin: Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday\r\nHilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off)\r\nBenjamin: YAAAAWN 🙊 Where and where are you meeting?\r\nHilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen\r\nBenjamin: Interesting 😱 To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear\r\nHilary: Oh come on 😂\r\nBenjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take\r\nHilary: We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. Oh wait, no, I'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol\r\nElliot: 🙉\r\nHilary: Do join us, we're going to have fun. And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps\r\nElliot: Sounds like a plan 😂\r\nHilary: 😎\r\nElliot: See you at 2 then xx\n---\nSummary:\n[/INST] Benjamin, Hilary, Elliot, and Daniel are discussing the keys that Hilary has. They are deciding if they should meet for lunch or drinks in the evening and if they should go to the apartment together. Benjamin is so tired from yesterday that he may take a nap instead of meeting for lunch. Hilary is meeting some French people at 2 pm at the entrance to the conference hall and then they will head to La Cantina, an Italian restaurant. Elliot is joining them for drinks in the evening.

Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

Deirdre: Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? you could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form.
Beth: I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those.

Deirdre: Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes.
Beth: Yes, I'd really like that. 
Deirdre: We can try a few hours on a Saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. If you like, we'll take it from there.

Deirdre: Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? you could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form.
Beth: I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those.

Beth: Maybe, but I'd like to try working. I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough.
Deirdre: I know. Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat.

Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go.

Kate: At long last! Started to worry. Nothing new happening, if you disregard all that Xmas craze. Momo has recovered from her injury and frolicking again.
Kate: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Good old Momo! Yes, it is your scarf!
Ola: NO!!! It's one of my favorites! The one from Laos!
Kate: Too late. Momo thinks it belongs to her now. Get yourself a new one. They surely have nice ones there.
Ola: Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs.
Ola: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Wait a sec!
Kate: &lt;file_photo&gt;
Kate: Isn't it similar?! Mum would probably like it. Why don't you?
Ola: Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually crappy.
Kate: And if you go to some boutique shop or something? Not at a market as in your pics?
Ola: I might try and find some. Would you like one too?

Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!
Neela: See ya, love!
Clara: Bye!

Maxine: So no presents 4 me? :(
Jesse: U'll get ur presents, no worries ;)
Maxine: Phew! Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;)
Melvin: Bt what do u have in store?
Jesse: Well, have u heard about the Refuge?
Lee: No. What's that?
Melvin: That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children?
Maxine: I think I've heard of them. So what about them?
Jesse: That's right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. 
Melvin: That's a great idea!
Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt;
Lee: I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange.
Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. 
Jesse: So it's settled?
Melvin: Yup.
Lee: Sure. 
Maxine: Fine.

Joanne: So I’m basically going to cheer her up 
Joanne: It’s really hard for her now

Joe: yeah, sure - just a few general tips :)
Joe: Start games before you start drinking :) And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones :)
Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
Tim: Got it :D 
Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? 
Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... 
Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)
Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)
Tim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.

Catherine: We're going to visit uncle Steve, want to come with us?
Ben: why would I?
Catherine: He's family and we haven't seen him in a long time.
Ben: you know very well that I'm not fond of such visits
Ben: they stress me out
Catherine: Come on, even you can do it from time to time.
Ben: maybe I can but I don't want to
Ben: it will end the same way as usual
Ben: with me being pissed at everyone
Catherine: The boys want to see you
Ben: I can visit you and play with them some other day
Ben: I don't have to drive to another city to do it
Catherine: You know that he'll be disappointed?
Ben: uncle Steve?
Catherine: Yes.
Ben: I don't think so, we don't have anything in common
Ben: all he ever does is bothering me with stupid questions about my private life
Catherine: Maybe that's his way of showing that he cares about you
Ben: yes... sure... sometimes I wonder if you're thinking about what you type :P
Catherine: Depends on the day
Catherine: Today I'm tired so I can't guarantee it
Ben: you should rest then
Ben: instead of asking me to do stuff I don't like
Catherine: Alright, don't worry, I'll stop
Catherine: But still the part about the boys missing you was true
Catherine: So come and visit them when you'll have the chance
Ben: I will

Guido suggests that Agata speaks to him in the JavaScript language, which Agata finds amusing.

Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?
Lynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think?
Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream.
Jess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?
Charlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!

Conny: You did?
Fitz: Certainly. Try it. You might find it's fun.
Conny: Doubt it. But I'll go Mr. Fitz. Obviously.

Bobby: U know what annoys me the most?
Mickey: Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions?
Bobby: That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs.
Mickey: Y? Aren't they good 4 ur health?
Bobby: They may well be, but not for my wallet!
Mickey: What do u mean?
Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on.
Mickey: And what of it?
Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. 
Mickey: All right, this is quite serious.
Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?
Bobby: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products!
Mickey: Srsly?!
Bobby: Absolutely!
Mickey: How long do u think they've been lying to us?
Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
Mickey: That is kinda puzzling.
Bobby: Right?
Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it?
Bobby: Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today?
Mickey: No.
Bobby: At least $1.2 bln!
Mickey: Explains a lot.
