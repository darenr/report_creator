        <h1>Model Evaluation Report</h1>
        
        <div class="report-description"><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves assessing the quality, relevance, coherence, and
        sometimes the factual accuracy of the text generated by these models. This evaluation is crucial for understanding
        a model's performance across various tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation. Several automated
        metrics have been developed to facilitate this evaluation process, each with its own focus and methodology. Some
        prominent evaluation methods including BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE.

    The metrics range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater similarity. ROUGE is more suitable for models that don't include paraphrasing and do not generate new text units that don't appear in the references. 
    The metrics are ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap), ROUGE-2 (bigram overlap), and ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence). The ROUGE scoreis calculated between the model's predictions and the human-produced references. A perfect model 
    would have a ROUGE score of 1.0, meaning the outputs from the model and the human-produced references are identical.

Whoever wants them can meet me at lunchtime or after\r\nElliot: I'm ok. We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?\r\nHilary: Yeah, I guess so\r\nDaniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me\r\nBenjamin: Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday\r\nHilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off)\r\nBenjamin: YAAAAWN 🙊 Where and where are you meeting?\r\nHilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen\r\nBenjamin: Interesting 😱 To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear\r\nHilary: Oh come on 😂\r\nBenjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take\r\nHilary: We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research.

Adam: Have you talked to May?
Karen: Yes, yesterday, why?
Adam: I just talked to her and I must admit I worry about her
Karen: Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn&#39;t very happy about it
Adam: No wonder...
Karen: I know, but I think this is serious. She&#39;s saying she&#39;s depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true
Adam: She was telling me she doesn&#39;t feel like doing anything, she&#39;s bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression
Adam: She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn&#39;t want to leave the flat
Karen: Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don&#39;t what to tell you
Adam: I was wondering how I can help her
Karen: Honestly I don&#39;t know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I&#39;m afraid we may unintentionally make it worse
Adam: Yes, but she doesn&#39;t want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn&#39;t want to see anyone
Karen: Hm... I don&#39;t know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do
Adam: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don&#39;t mention her name
Karen: Of course I won&#39;t! I have a friend who&#39;s a psychologist, we can trust her. I&#39;ll let you know

Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It&#39;s about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That&#39;s the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it&#39;s mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it&#39;s rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How&#39;s that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there&#39;s also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I&#39;m not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I&#39;ll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I&#39;m just watching the rest of a movie and I&#39;ll try Dear White People.

Adam: Have you talked to May?
Karen: Yes, yesterday, why?
Adam: I just talked to her and I must admit I worry about her
Karen: Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn&#39;t very happy about it
Adam: No wonder...
Karen: I know, but I think this is serious. She&#39;s saying she&#39;s depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true
Adam: She was telling me she doesn&#39;t feel like doing anything, she&#39;s bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression
Adam: She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn&#39;t want to leave the flat
Karen: Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don&#39;t what to tell you
Adam: I was wondering how I can help her
Karen: Honestly I don&#39;t know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I&#39;m afraid we may unintentionally make it worse
Adam: Yes, but she doesn&#39;t want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn&#39;t want to see anyone
Karen: Hm... I don&#39;t know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do
Adam: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don&#39;t mention her name
Karen: Of course I won&#39;t! I have a friend who&#39;s a psychologist, we can trust her. I&#39;ll let you know
Adam: Thank you Karen!

Gloria: You can&#39;t really get prepared, it&#39;s all about experience
Emma: But there are some rules and some typical texts right?
Gloria: You can see some texts from previous years
Gloria: &lt;file_other&gt;
Emma: Wow that&#39;s very useful
Emma: I have never seen this site
Gloria: Yes it&#39;s very good
Gloria: Actually it&#39;s good to read all the texts because you will see that some phrases repeat very often
Emma: How much time do you have for all 4 parts?
Gloria: 4 hours
Emma: Is it enough?
Gloria: Well it has to be
Gloria: Would be perfect to have 2 more hours... But on the other hand it would be really exhausting
Emma: 4 hours and no breaks?
Gloria: No breaks :/ So it&#39;s really important to be really focused and try to write as fast as you can
Gloria: And read it carefully and correct during the last hour
Emma: I&#39;m going to read everything from that website, it&#39;s great

Ola: Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs.

Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It&#39;s about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That&#39;s the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it&#39;s mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it&#39;s rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How&#39;s that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there&#39;s also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I&#39;m not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I&#39;ll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I&#39;m just watching the rest of a movie and I&#39;ll try Dear White People.
Clara: Don&#39;t blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!

Lee: No. What&#39;s that?
Melvin: That&#39;s the Christmas foundation to help women and children?
Maxine: I think I&#39;ve heard of them. So what about them?
Jesse: That&#39;s right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. 
Melvin: That&#39;s a great idea!
Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt; &lt;file_other&gt;

Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we&#39;ll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I&#39;m in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily.

Jaya: so sorry to hear that, what happened?
Ravi: She has been suffering from knee pain for almost 5 years now and the doctor has asked her to restrict movement.

Joe: yeah, sure - just a few general tips :)
Joe: Start games before you start drinking :) And don&#39;t bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones :)
Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
Tim: Got it :D 
Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some &#39;vanilla&#39; games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? 
Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... 
Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)
Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)
Tim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.

Guido: Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t know anything about Java? :(
Agata: Thanks for the concern :) All my Twitter posts go to my Facebook account. I think I might change that! 
Guido: Don&#39;t worry :)
Agata: By the way, it&#39;s JavaScript, not Java. Except for the name they really have not much in common :)
Guido: Sounds like Chinese to me :(
Agata: :)
Guido: It&#39;s hard to understand the concept :(
Agata: Sorry. After just one month of coding I would be like plain English to you :P

Guido suggests that Agata speaks to him in the JavaScript language, which Agata finds amusing.</td>

Lynn: Well...
Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn?
Lynn: I&#39;m not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it&#39;s just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don&#39;t you think?
Jess: I guess? 
Charlie: I&#39;ve read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people&#39;s faces, and it uses them when we dream.
Jess: So you&#39;re telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood?
Charlie: Exactly! You don&#39;t even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.

Mickey: What do u mean?
Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there&#39;s a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on.
Mickey: And what of it?
Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I&#39;m not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I&#39;ve never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.
