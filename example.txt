Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they
were doing when they first heard about the contest. I was sitting in my
hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my video
feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night.

I’d heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the videogame
designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked virtual
reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis. The unprecedented
success of the OASIS had made Halliday one of the wealthiest people in
the world.

At first, I couldn’t understand why the media was making such a big
deal of the billionaire’s death. After all, the people of Planet Earth had
other concerns. The ongoing energy crisis. Catastrophic climate change.
Widespread famine, poverty, and disease. Half a dozen wars. You know:
“dogs and cats living together . . . mass hysteria!” Normally, the newsfeeds didn’t interrupt everyone’s interactive sitcoms and soap operas unless something really major had happened. Like the outbreak of some
new killer virus, or another major city vanishing in a mushroom cloud.
Big stuff like that. As famous as he was, Halliday’s death should have warranted only a brief segment on the evening news, so the unwashed masses
could shake their heads in envy when the newscasters announced the obscenely large amount of money that would be doled out to the rich man’s
heirs.
